# LaptopInsight-Cleaning

This project is focused on cleaning and preprocessing a raw laptop dataset to prepare it for analysis and future machine learning tasks.

## 📌 Project Goals
- Load and explore the dataset
- Handle missing values
- Clean numeric and string columns
- Prepare the dataset for visualization and modeling

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Files in This Repository
- `laptop.csv` - Original raw dataset
- `laptop_cleaning.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook with cleaning steps

### ✅ Review of  Project Structure:
| File/Folder             | Purpose                                                     |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.venv/`                | Local virtual environment (Good practice)                   |
| `laptop_cleaning.ipynb` | Main notebook for data cleaning                             |
| `laptop.csv`            | Raw data file                                               |
| `main.py`               | Placeholder for running logic (you can add CLI/script here) |
| `README.md`             | Project description file ✅                                  |
| `.gitignore`            | Keeps `.venv` and other files out of Git                    |
| `pyproject.toml`        | Project dependencies and metadata ✅                         |
| `uv.lock`               | Lockfile for consistent installs (like `Pipfile.lock`)      |
| `dist/`, `*.egg-info`   | Created during packaging (you can ignore for now)           |

### 📌 SetUp
```bash
1. Clone this repo
2. Run uv sync cammand
```

## 🧹 Cleaning Steps Overview
- Removed unnamed/extra columns
- Handled null values
- Cleaned columns like `Price`, `RAM`, and `Weight`
- Planned feature engineering

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Clone this repo
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter
3. Run the cells to see the cleaning process
4. see setup steps
