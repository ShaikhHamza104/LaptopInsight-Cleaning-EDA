## 🔢 Features

- **Univariate Analysis**: Analyze and visualize single variables.
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Explore relationships between two variables.
- **Modular Code**: Each analysis type in its own Python file.
- **Simple Interface**: Easy to integrate with Streamlit or CLI.

## 🏃 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShaikhHamza104/LaptopInsight-Cleaning-EDA.git
cd LaptopInsight-Cleaning-EDA
```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
```

3. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Run the app**
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### 🎓 Usage
- Modify `univariate_analysis.py` to add histograms , boxplots, etc.

- Edit `bivariate_analysis.py` for scatter plots, heatmaps, etc.

- app.py integrates all functions and serves them.

### 📖 Requirements

- pandas

- numpy

- matplotlib / seaborn / plotly
